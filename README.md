# hbloader-nro
An NRO version of nx-hbloader

You need to use the [original nx-hbloader](https://github.com/switchbrew/nx-hbloader/releases/) to use this (ironic, isn't it?). It doesn't work through the nx-hbloader NSP, but it works through the album just fine. To use this, you need an NRO placed at `sdmc:/switch/Goldleaf.nro`. Goldleaf was picked because it looks different than [nx-hbmenu](https://github.com/switchbrew/nx-hbmenu) and because it loads NROs in the same way nx-hbmenu does.
